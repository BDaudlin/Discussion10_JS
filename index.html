                <p>Hey, my name is Brennen Daudlin and as of 2024, I am a junior at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I'm currently studying in the College of Engineering, aiming towards a bachelors in computer science with the ultimate end goal of going to graduate school, though I am still unsure if I should go for a masters or a postdoc. What ever I decide to do, I'll make sure to do my best! Focusing on this, it was made as an assignment for the common class project in SI 339 and I'll make sure to do my best to ensure that this webpage is of the highest quality.</p>
